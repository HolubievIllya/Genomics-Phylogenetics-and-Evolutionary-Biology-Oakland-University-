### Assignment 1 Genomic Browsers and Databases


#### Task 1. Genes: Use any database or combination of them to investigate the following genes and provide answers.
  | Gene name | Ð¡hrom | Position | Impact\role\significance |
  | :---: | --- | :---: | :---: |
  | BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) | Chr 17 | q21.31 | BRCA1 is a human tumor suppressor gene. Some of variations can increase risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer at an earlier age |
  | TP53 (Tumor Protein p53) | Chr 17 | p13.1 | TP53 encodes a tumor suppressor protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome |
  | APOE (Apolipoprotein E) | Chr 19 | q13.32 | The protein encoded by this gene is a major apoprotein of the chylomicron. Mutations in this gene result in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP III), in which increased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are the consequence of impaired clearance of chylomicron and VLDL remnants |
  | CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) | Chr 7 | q31.2 | This gene encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Mutations in this gene cause cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disorder in populations of Northern European descent |
  | HBB (Hemoglobin Subunit Beta) | Chr 11 | p15.4 | The HBB gene encodes beta globin. Mutations in the HBB gene may lead to several conditions, the best known of which are sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, as well as beneficial aspects such as resistance to malaria |


#### Task 2. Variation function: Use any database or combination of them to investigate the following SNPs(single nucleotide polymorphisms) and provide answers
  | Variant name | Gene | Reference | Alternative | Suggested Impact\function |
  | :---: | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
